# Mega-War
#### Mega War is similar to War, but you can play with more than 1 deck and more than 2 players. The winner will be the player who accumulates all the cards. When Mega War starts, the program will ask for the number of decks, and the number of players. 
There's a feature called *Fierceness* of the player's hand. You can imagine that a hand that has many high-value cards is more likely to win than a hand that has many low-value cards. The Fierceness of a hand is the average value of all cards. A hand that has a King, Queen, 9 and 3 has a Fierceness value of 9.25. A hand that has 3, 8, 5 and Jack has a Fierceness value of 6.75. Based solely on that value, we might expect the first player to win the game
